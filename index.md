## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the school of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), honored to be supervised by Prof. [Yazhou Yao](http://www.milab-nust.com/milab/web/currentmembershow.html?id=18). Since starting my Ph.D., I have been a long-term research intern at Zhejiang University, honored to be supervised by Prof. [Wenguan Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/wenguanwang). Before that,  I received my undergraduate degree from the college of Qian-Xuesen, Nanjing University of Science and Technology.
